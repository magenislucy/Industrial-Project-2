# Opinion Formation – Multiple Opinions and Ageing

## Description:
It is commonly observed that people’s political affiliations are correlated with other opinions they may hold, for example, which media they prefer to watch, or likelihood to seek out a Covid vaccination. It has also been found that political opinions tend to evolve as a person ages, irrespective of other factors. Standard models demonstrate that clustering, or consensus, of ideas occurs over time, something that is also observed in real data. Political Observers Scotland are interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these correlations, and how they affect the clustering of opinions. They have seen some results of simple models and are interested in understanding if and how they can be applied in more realistic situations. In particular, they are hoping to determine how such models work when
individuals can hold opinions about multiple topics, and also if an age-dependent ‘drift’ of opinion is introduced.

## Aims:
Political Observers Scotland wish to understand some/all of the following:
- Can the model treat multiple opinions, on different topics?
- If so, what does it tell us about the formation of such opinions and any correlation between them?
- How can the model be extended to(wards) an ageing population whose opinion ‘naturally’ drifts as they age?
- Again, what does the model tell us when applied to such a set-up?
- Is there any real-world data that the model can be benchmarked against? In particular, is it possible to determine reasonable values for any of the parameters?
